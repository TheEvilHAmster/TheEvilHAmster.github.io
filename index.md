Nice to meet you! I am a games programmer 


## Unity

I have made [Vaccunaut](https://futuregames.itch.io/vacuunaut) where I worked on the enviroment such as the doors, pipes and garbage. I also helped the other disiplines to understand what us programmers where doing and helped with the version controll system (perforce). 
I helped dunderstand how the eventsystem workes and set it up in the way they wanted it to be. 

What i learned from this Group project that i can take with me is that there is a huge diffrence working with a designated PM and not working with one, as it made comunication alot easyer and made the team more brought together as it was teh first time I worked with a full (learning) team with teh rolls Project manager, Product owner, designers, QA, atrists and programmers. What I also learned from this was that most problems can be solved by asking the team as we are working on this together we can solve most problems together as when there are weird buggs we have all experianced diffrent buggs but worked thrue them and improved.

The [Trailer](https://youtu.be/0V0YkGQosFc) for the game can be found here.


## Unreal Engine

I have made [No More Monkey Business](https://futuregames.itch.io/no-more-monkey-business) where I worked with unreals chaos system on [unreal 4.27-chaos branch](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Physics/ChaosPhysics/ChaosDestruction/) which wasnt complete and had some buggs, so there was somethings we adopted to and some we needed to ignore as it was fount to late in the groject (there was functions that hadent ben inplemented yet so it crashed the game).
What I worked on was I started the to use the chaos system and because of that we used that to make the world destructable as the game is about destroying an office enviroment so chaos system was perfect for the idea. I also worked on making the police projectiles. I worked on the facing direction of the player so it moves in 8 directions as well as the timer that was implemented with a asset so it could be accessed by diffrent systems.

What i worked on in this project was: 
- Introdused the chaos system from Unreal
- The police projectiles
- Timer system
- Spawner system for the police
