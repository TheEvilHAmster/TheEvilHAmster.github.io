Nice to meet you! I am a games programmer 

## THIS IS WIP

I am working on this but have some info and in Socials

## Unity

I have made [Vaccunaut](https://futuregames.itch.io/vacuunaut) where I worked on the enviroment such as the doors, pipes and garbage. I also helped the other disiplines to understand what us programmers where doing and helped with the version controll system (perforce). 
I helped dunderstand how the eventsystem workes and set it up in the way they wanted it to be. 

What i learned from this Group project that i can take with me is that there is a huge diffrence working with a designated PM and not working with one, as it made comunication alot easyer and made the team more brought together as it was teh first time I worked with a full (learning) team with teh rolls Project manager, Product owner, designers, QA, atrists and programmers. What I also learned from this was that most problems can be solved by asking the team as we are working on this together
