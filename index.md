Nice to meet you! I am a games programmer  


## Unity 

I have made [Vaccunaut](https://futuregames.itch.io/vacuunaut) where I worked on the environment such as the doors, pipes and garbage. I also helped the other disciplines to understand what us programmers where doing and helped with the version control system (perforce).  

I helped understand how the event system works and set it up in the way they wanted it to be.  

What I learned from this Group project that I can take with me is that there is a huge difference working with a designated PM and not working with one, as it made communication a lot easier and made the team more brought together as it was the first time I worked with a full (learning) team with the rolls Project manager, Product owner, designers, QA, artists and programmers. What I also learned from this was that most problems can be solved by asking the team as we are working on this together we can solve most problems together as when there are weird bugs we have all experienced different bugs but worked through them and improved.  

The [Trailer](https://youtu.be/0V0YkGQosFc) for the game can be found here. 




## Unreal Engine 

I have made [No More Monkey Business](https://futuregames.itch.io/no-more-monkey-business) where I worked with Unreals chaos system on [unreal 4.27-chaos branch](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Physics/ChaosPhysics/ChaosDestruction/) which wasn't complete and had some bugs, so there were somethings we adopted to and some we needed to ignore as it was fount to late in the project (there was functions that hadn't been implemented yet, so it crashed the game). 

  
What I worked on in this project was:  
<br>
<details> 

<summary>Introduced the chaos system from Unreal</summary> 

I started the to use the chaos system and because of that we used that to make the world destructible as the game is about destroying an office environment, so chaos system was perfect for the idea. 

</details> 
<br>
<details> 

<summary>Timer system</summary> 

The timer that was implemented as an asset so it could be accessed by different systems such as the elevator, police spawner and displayed time. 

</details> 
<br>
<details> 

<summary> The police projectiles</summary> 

I implemented the police projectiles to make them hit the player and so that they interacted on the way we wanted it to work. 

</details> 
<br>
<details> 

<summary>Spawner system</summary> 
A spawner that you can set after how long you want something to spawn and how many to spawn and if there should be a delay between spawns. 
  
</details> 
<br>
<details> 

<summary>Facing 8 directions</summary> 

Unreal forces smooth rotations but as we wanted the controls to feel arcade, so we made the player snap instead.

I have made [Ballistic Hamsters](https://futuregames.itch.io/ballistic-hamsters) 

In Ballistic Hamsters I worked on the powerup system which didn't get that implemented at the end as it made the game to unbalanced which was a bit of a let-down but I'm happy with the system, so I'll take that as a good experience. As the game is a PvP PvE game I learned to use some of the built-in networking system in Unreal which I definitely think is good experience and I will take it with me how thing changes a bit when you need to think with networking in mind.
